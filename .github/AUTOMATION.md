# 🤖 Automated PR Review & CI System

This repository includes comprehensive automation for pull request reviews and continuous integration. Here's what's included:

## 🔄 Automated Workflows

### 1. **Automated PR Review** (`automated-pr-review.yml`)
- **Triggers**: When PRs are opened, updated, or reopened
- **Features**:
  - 🐹 **Go Code Analysis**: Runs `go vet` and checks for common patterns (error handling, logging)
  - 🌐 **API Changes Detection**: Identifies API-related changes and provides review checklist
  - 🗄️ **Database Changes**: Detects database/migration changes with safety checklist  
  - 🐳 **Docker Changes**: Reviews Docker-related modifications
  - 🏷️ **Auto-labeling**: Automatically adds relevant labels based on changed files
  - 👥 **Auto-assignment**: Assigns repository owner as reviewer
  - 💡 **Smart Recommendations**: Provides context-aware suggestions

### 2. **PR Size & Complexity Analysis** (`pr-analysis.yml`)
- **Triggers**: PR events
- **Features**:
  - 📊 **Size Classification**: XS/S/M/L/XL based on lines changed
  - 🏷️ **Size Labels**: Visual indicators of PR complexity
  - 📈 **Statistics**: Detailed metrics on files, lines, test coverage
  - 💡 **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improvement
  - ⚠️ **Warnings**: Alerts for large PRs or missing tests

### 3. **Enhanced CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop branches, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - ✅ **Automatic Execution**: No approval required
  - 🧪 **Go Testing**: Unit tests with race detection and coverage
  - 🔍 **Code Quality**: Linting with golangci-lint
  - 🏗️ **Build Verification**: Ensures code compiles
  - 📚 **Documentation**: Auto-generates Swagger docs
  - 📊 **Coverage Reports**: Uploads to Codecov

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Contributors:
1. **Open a PR** → Automated review starts immediately
2. **Receive feedback** → Get instant code analysis and recommendations  
3. **Auto-labeling** → PRs get relevant labels automatically
4. **Size guidance** → Know if your PR is too large
5. **CI runs automatically** → No waiting for approvals

### For Maintainers:
1. **Smart notifications** → Only get pinged for PRs that need attention
2. **Pre-reviewed PRs** → Automated analysis helps focus review time
3. **Consistent labeling** → All PRs get standardized labels
4. **Quality gates** → CI must pass before merge
5. **Auto-approval** → Trusted changes get approved automatically

## 🛡️ Security & Safety

- **Permissions**: Workflows use minimal required permissions
- **Trusted sources**: Auto-approval only for specific file types and authors
- **Code safety**: No automated merging of code changes
- **Review requirements**: Code changes always require human review
- **Dependency scanning**: Dependabot PRs get special handling

## 🔧 Configuration

### Manual Workflow Triggers:
- **CI**: Go to Actions → CI → Run workflow

### Customization:
- **Review rules**: Edit `automated-pr-review.yml`
- **Size thresholds**: Adjust limits in `pr-analysis.yml`
- **Labels**: All standardized labels are already created in the repository

## 📊 Expected Benefits

- ⚡ **Faster reviews**: Automated analysis highlights important areas
- 🎯 **Better quality**: Consistent checks and recommendations
- 🤖 **Less manual work**: Automated labeling, sizing, and assignments
- 🛡️ **Safety**: Multiple checks before merging
- 📈 **Visibility**: Clear metrics and progress tracking

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Merge this PR** to activate all automation
2. **Open a test PR** to see automation in action
3. **Customize** workflows as needed for your team

## 🏷️ Available Labels

The following labels are automatically created and used by the automation:

**Size Labels**: `size/XS`, `size/S`, `size/M`, `size/L`, `size/XL`
**Technology**: `go`, `api`, `database`, `docker`, `tests`, `documentation`, `ci/cd`  
**Process**: `auto-merge`, `needs-review`, `review-approved`, `work-in-progress`
**Priority**: `priority/low`, `priority/medium`, `priority/high`, `priority/critical`

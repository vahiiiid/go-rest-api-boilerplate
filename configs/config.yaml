# Go REST API Boilerplate - Base Configuration

# 
# CONFIGURATION PRIORITY (highest to lowest):
# 1. Environment variables (.env file)
# 2. Environment-specific config (config.production.yaml, config.staging.yaml, etc.)
# 3. This base configuration file (config.yaml) - YOU ARE HERE
#
# üîß Environment variables can override any setting below
# üìù See .env.example for common overrides
# üåç See config.{environment}.yaml for environment-specific defaults
